First of all, Thank you for stopping by.

# Who am I?
Hi, I am `Tauseef Jamadar`, a *Software Engineer* and a *Technology Enthusiast* from Chico, CA who loves to write software to build great products
and help business succeed with their goals. 

I was born in Mumbai, India and travelled to the United States for my masters program in Computer Science from [CSU, Chico][csu-chico] and graduated with Honors in the year 2011.

I have over 8 years professional experience developing for the web and mobile platforms. I am aspiring to learn, grow and share the knowledge. I started real world programming from the year 2010, since then I have come far and learnt a lot. I am constantly looking to work on exciting projects.

#### I believe in the statement -
> "Programming is limited to your imagination"


# What is this site about?
Starting a blog and creating an online presense, to share my learnings was always on my todo list. Finally today I decided to start doing it.
I want to use this site as a place to share my experiences with interesting programing problem solving, hoping someone will benefit from the findings.
